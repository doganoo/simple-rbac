# simple-rbac
Simple leightweight PHP Role Based Access Control library

## How does this library work?

I have tried to keep things simple. The main idea was to let the user implement an interface which provides the user and his permissions. The permissions are assigned to roles and roles are assigned to users. 

The library provides a simple way to verify permissions without re-inventing the wheel.

The library is also available on Packagist: https://packagist.org/packages/doganoo/simple-rbac
